Hi I am Khan Mokabbel Hossain.
I have around eight years of working experiences as a QA in IT industry. I had starded my career as a Qualit Assurance in all phases of 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).    

I started my career in manual testing. I had little progaramming language knowledge when I was doing manual testing. Beside I had a friend name Romesh whos was 
Automation Tester.He gave me inspiration to build my career as a Automation Tester, beside I was feeling good in programming language. This way gradually I moved 
to Automation Tester.   

Through out my career I worked as a manual and automation tester across various domain such as insurance, Bank and financial, E-commerce mostly for web based applications where
I performed front end, API and back end testing. I also have good knowledge in developing test senarios, test cases, test data, test strategy, test plans, test reports ( based on
acceptance criteria and wireframe). I also created automation test scripts using Selenium WebDriver API with Java.

I did different type of testing like Smoke Testing, Sanity Testing, Regression Testing, Integration Testing, Database Testing etc. 

* You need to talk about your first project:
	-Talk about domain (tdbank.com was the domain name that I worked with).  
	-What type of framework you used I (if you do automation  testing).For manual testing talk about how and where you had written test case and execute.     
	-How long you worked there. 
( If any question "tell me about yourself in manual testing" then answer will be  like this " I created test, I created test scenario, during creating test I used Xcel spread sheet, I wrote test case based on acceptance criteria.  Then they can ask that you are working with Agile then where you got acceptance criteria.  Its reply will be – we did back log refinement  meeting and during this meeting  many questions were raised, I  talked with product owner, sometimes communicated with product owner regarding these questions  by  mail keeping cc to other members, and accordingly the test cases I write in Xcel spread sheet and also I put test case number as reference.  Based on that Xcel spread sheet  I executed these test manually and generated the report. When I got defect , I took its screen shot and kept in share point, and same time I added the  link of the concern test case. I also talked with developer and used this case number as reference”.  Talk around  one to two minutes about your first project.      

* You need to talk about your second project:
Same thing you can add what you mentioned in your first project.
	-Talk about domain 
	-What type of framework you used I (if you do automation  testing).For manual testing talk about how and where you had written test case and execute.    
We used data driven framework tool in my second project. We used Maven project , Java programming language. We used Selenium, TestNg, ItestListener,  Data provider annotation.  we kept test cases in Xcel spread sheet. So these way I completed the tests.  I added lot of features in framework eventhough I did not build the framework. ( take some features strongly in your grip).  I added log4j as a feature in the framework. After adding log4j I was able to generate the execution login.  ( they may ask who decided to add log4j in the framework. My answer will be like this –“  I personally ask my team leader what benefit we will get after adding the log4j, then a meeting was called and I gave demo and showing benefits of log4j and finally it was decided by all to add log4j. 
	- What are the tools you used and which tool was used for which framework.
	-How long you worked there. 
Talk around four to five minutes about your second project. 
* You need to talk about your third project:
Same as second project but you  must tell that you have made the project so that they understand you can make the framework. 
	-Talk about domain  
	-What type of framework you used I (if you do automation  testing).For manual testing talk about how and where you had written test case and execute.     
	- What are the tools you used and which tool was used for which framework.
Here I used BDD Cucumber framework ( this is current project).  Also will be added here restriction test  API.
	-How long you worked there.

Through out my career, I worked in many different operating systems like Windows, Mac, Unix. Our company’s server is hosted on Unix operating systems; 
therefore, I have good knowledge in Unix. In my current company, we are following agile methodology; every two weeks we have a new sprint. At the beginning of the 
sprint, we have a sprint-planning meeting; we have standup meeting everyday, at the end of our sprint we have sprint demo meeting, and we also have retrospective 
meeting. Normally, after our sprint-planning meeting, I start selecting the test cases that are good for automation testing. Then daily basis I write automation 
test code.
