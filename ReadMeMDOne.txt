Hi I am Khan Mokabbel Hossain.
I have around eight years of working experiences as a QA in IT industry. I had started my career as a Quality Assurance in all phases of Software Development 
Life Cycle (SDLC) and Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC). I started my career in manual testing. I had little programming language knowledge when I was doing 
manual testing. Beside I had a friend name Romesh who was an Automation Tester. He gave me inspiration to build my career as an Automation Tester, 
beside I was feeling good in programming language. This way gradually I moved to Automation Tester.   
Through out my career I worked as a manual and automation tester across various domain such as insurance, Bank and financial, E-commerce mostly for 
web based applications where I performed front end, API and back end testing. I also have good knowledge in developing test scenarios, test cases, test data, 
test strategy, test plans, test reports ( based on acceptance criteria and wireframe). I also created automation test scripts using Selenium WebDriver API with Java.
I did different type of testing like Smoke Testing, Sanity Testing, Regression Testing, Integration Testing, Database Testing etc.

I would like tell describe all projects I did in my career. 
* About my first project:
	- My domain name was TD Bank.
	-   I created test, I created test scenario, during creating test I used Xcel spread sheet, I wrote 
test case based on acceptance criteria. I worked with Agile- here did back log refinement  meeting and during this meeting  many questions were raised, 
I  talked with product owner, sometimes communicated with product owner regarding these questions  by  mail keeping cc to other members, and accordingly 
the test cases I write in Xcel spread sheet and also I put test case number as reference.  Based on that Xcel spread sheet  I executed these test manually and 
generated the report. When I got defect , I took its screen shot and kept in share point, and same time I added the  link of the concern test case. 
I also talked with developer and used this case number as reference.
        - I worked here two and three months as a Manual Tester.
	 
* About my Second project:
	- I worked here with a E-commerce domain.
	-I used here Data Driven Framework.    
	-The tools I used here - I used Maven Project, Java programming Language,  Selenium,  TestNg,  IItestListener, I created TestNg Suit,  I kept test data 
	  in X-cell spread sheet, I used Data Provider annotation.  So these way I completed the tests. Beside I added lot of features in framework even though 
	  I did not build the framework.  I added log4j as a feature in the framework. After adding log4j I was able to generate the execution login.  If you ask me 
	  who decided to add Log4j in the framework. My answer will be  – I personally asked my team leader what benefit we will get after adding the log4j, then 
	  I made demo where benefits of  Log4J were shown. Then a meeting was called within our team and I gave demo showing benefits of log4j and finally it was 
	  decided by all to add log4j.
        - I worked here three years and eight months as an Automation Tester.

* About my Third and Current project:
	- I worked here with a E-commerce domain.
	- Here I built the project myself.  
	-I used here BDD Cucumber Framework.    
	-The tools you used here are…..
        -I am working here since last four years as an Automation Tester.


Through out my career, I worked in many different operating systems like Windows, Mac, Unix. Our company’s server is hosted on Unix operating systems; 
therefore, I have good knowledge in Unix. In my current company, we are following agile methodology; every two weeks we have a new sprint. At the beginning of the 
sprint, we have a sprint-planning meeting; we have standup meeting everyday, at the end of our sprint we have sprint demo meeting, and we also have retrospective 
meeting. Normally, after our sprint-planning meeting, I start selecting the test cases that are good for automation testing. Then daily basis I write automation 
test code.
